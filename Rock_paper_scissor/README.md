# Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊✋✌️
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors, built using HTML and JavaScript. It's a project from [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum, aimed at practicing basic web development concepts.

## How to Play 🎮

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will be presented with a dialog box to choose either rock, paper, or scissors. Click on your choice, and the computer will randomly select its choice as well. The winner will be determined according to the standard rules of the game:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

The result of the game will be displayed on the console, indicating whether you won, lost, or if it's a tie.

## Features ✨

- Random computer selection for added challenge.
- Instant display of game results.

## Files Included 📁

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic.
